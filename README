AdbWirelessInject:
		Usage: AdbWirelessInject <SSID> <Password> <"WPA" or "WEP">
		
		Source: AdbWirelessInject.cpp
InstallSystemWideCpp:
		This program a cpp file as argument and installs it on the system.
		
		Usage: InstallSystemWideCpp <cpp file here>
		
		Source: InstallSystemWideCpp.cpp

Loopthis:
		This program takes any command as argument, and runs(loops) it every second. 
		Please use " " if you have a space in your command, as it will separate it into two.
		
		Usage: Loopthis <command to run>
		
		(it is recommended to put commands in "" to prevent any errors from occuring)

		Source code: Loopthis.cpp

Math:
		Simple math functions described in a little program for some calculations in shell.

		Usage: 	Math <any simple math function>
			Math 4 x 2
			Math 16 / 623

		Source code: Math.cpp

SleepnRun:
		The program takes two arguments and then runs the first argument as a command in 
		the shell <second argument> seconds after the program is runned.

		Usage: 	SleepnRun <command> <seconds to wait before running command>
			SleepnRun poweroff 12

		Source code: SleepnRun.cpp
	
Spammer:
		Wireless station beacon spammer program that uses aircrack-ng and SleepnRun executables.
		It is a bit like mdk3. The program has several checks for any action the program does to 
		prevent errors and provide program stability. In fact the program is capable of running 
		by itself without any arguments or any human input. 
		
		Source code: Spammer.cpp

		Arguments:
			t <number>	-	Define how many wifi networks you want
						(Maximum is 30)
			s		-	Enable WPA2 psk security
			b <mac>		-	Enable custom MAC for all networks
			e <essid>	-	Enable custom ESSID for all networks
			c <number>	-	Broadcast networks on one channel
			l <essid>	-	Set an ESSID base for network names
						--(ESSID consist of the base and a random number
						example: testessid-67438)
						--(will be ignored if ESSID is already set)
			p <characters>	-	Give characters to the program to generate random
						ESSID names with.
						--(Will not be used if ESSID or ESSID base is already set)
			f <file path>		Read each line from a file and use that as ESSID. If the
						names are not enough for the runtimes of the program then
						the naming scheme will repeat and new networks will have 
						the same names as old ones.
						--(Will be ignored is ESSID is already set)
			i <interface>		Set a default wireless interface that will be used if mon0
						is not started yet. If not set the program will try to 
						detect common wireless interfaces on the system (wlp1s0,
						wlan0).
						--(If the system has wlan0 or wlp1s0 interface then this
						argument is unnecessary)

			(If different arguments are not
			present, values will be generated 
			randomly for every integer possible.)	
		
		Usage:	Spammer t 12 l "C.I.A secret line" c 6
			Spammer t 3 c 2
			Spammer t 30 l "Matt is gay"
				(Don't do that though, that would be rude...)

		Requirements:
			-airbase-ng program from aircrack-ng binary
			-SleepnRun
WirelessConnect:
		A simple executable that takes two arguments and runs wpa_supplicant with a configuration 
		file on a wireless interface. After the wpa_supplicant connecting is over the program will
		ping google.com to make sure that the computer has internet connection.
		
		Usage: WirelessConnect <interface name> <configuration file>
	
		Source code: WirelessConnect.cpp

Analyzer & Downloader:
		Early version of a file downloader program.
