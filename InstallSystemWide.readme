This program has to get a Linux executable path as argument, and it makes the executable usable system-wide. 
This program does not copy other files that are required by the executable.
It only makes the executable system-wide, not every file needed by the program to work.

I tested this program in Ubuntu 16.04 LTS  only. It should work in any other linux distro, because of it's simplicity.

Source code: InstallSystemWide.cpp

Architecture: x86, x64, arm
